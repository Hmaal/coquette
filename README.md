My entry for Ludum Dare 26.

If you crash into a bubble, a bubble is created. If you shoot, a bubble is created. If your bullet hits a bubble that is not touching any other bubbles, a bubble is created. If your bullet hits a bubble that is touching other bubbles, all of them are destroyed. If you create more than thirty bubbles, you are destroyed.
